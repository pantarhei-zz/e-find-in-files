============================================
Notes:
============================================

This is NOT A PRODUCTION QUALITY PIECE OF SOFTWARE.
It may crash at times. You have been warned.

FindInFiles stores search history information under the following registry key


  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\e-addons\FindInFiles


Otherwise FindInFiles will not modify your system at all.

============================================
Install:
============================================

* Step 0:

You need the dot net framework v2 to run this. If you don't have it installed, go get it from microsoft.
This also means the regex search is using the .net regex engine NOT PCRE

* Step 1: 

Copy the FindInFiles.exe anywhere you like on your system.
I Recommend putting it in your E support path just for consistency's sake.

On vista, I have mine in this path:

C:\Users\Orion\AppData\Roaming\e\Support\bin

on XP, that would be

C:\Documents and Settings\Orion\Application Data\e\Support\bin

* Step 2: 

Launch the E bundle editor. Under text files, create a new command. 
Call it whatever you like, although I find "find in files" is nice :-)

For this new command, it should be as follows:
Environment: Windows Native
Input: Selected Text or Word
Output: Show as HTML
Activation: Key Equivalent: Ctrl-Shift-F (or whatever you want)
Scope Selector: empty

The bundle contents (big text box) should be set as follows:

If you've put the FindInFiles.exe in the recommended, path above, then use the following:
"%APPDATA%\e\Support\bin\FindInFiles.exe"

Otherwise use the full quoted path to where you placed FindInFiles.exe. It doesn't need any command line arguments

** BUG:
  As of writing, E has a 'bug' where it shows the command line for all windows native applications
  This means that every time you run findinfiles, E will show the command line before the search results.
  
  Switching the command to run in the Cygwin(generic) environment fixes this, but running under the
  cygwin environment causes the 'current directory' and 'project directory' buttons to return invalid results.
  
  IE: Under cygwin, they will return '/cygdrive/c/someproject/somedir/' instead of 'C:\someproject\somedir'.
  FindInFiles cannot understand these paths so you'll have to manually edit the path.
  
  Pick which bug you like, or annoy alexander on the E forums to fix the E-native-windows command line problem :-)

* Step 3: 

In E, with any file open, hit ctrl-shift-f (or whatever key equivalent you assigned above)


============================================
Usage:
============================================

In the 'Find What' box, enter any text. 
  - If you tick 'use Regular Expressions', then you may use .NET compatible regexes here.
  - If you tick 'Match case', then the search will be case-sensitive (affects regexes also)
  - Press the 'W' button to insert the current word that the cursor is positioned over in the editor (uses TM_CURRENT_WORD)

In the 'Look In' box, enter the path to the directory to search.
  - Press the 'C' button to insert the current directory of the file you are editing (uses TM_DIRECTORY)
  - Press the 'P' button to insert the project directory (uses TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY)
  - Press the '...' button to browse for a directory

In the 'Look at these file types' box, enter the file extensions to search. 
  - Enter file types in *.ext form, separated by either commas or semicolons. 
    - You may use spaces to make it look prettier, but these will be ignored

  - For example
    *.rb, *.rhtml, *.rjs

In the 'Exclude these directories' box, enter the names of directories to skip.

  - You must enter full directory names - you can't use *xyz* for example.
  - separate entries with either commas or semicolons.
  - as directory names may include spaces, you can't use spaces in between the separators
  - It is a REALLY good idea to put .svn in this box if you are using subversion

  - For example
    .svn;.CVS;tmp;log

Hit the 'Find All' button or press Enter to begin the search.

Press escape while searching to cancel


============================================
Uninstall:
============================================

- Remove the FindInFiles.exe from wherever you put it.
- Remove the Bundle command from E using the bundle editor
- Remove the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\e-addons\FindInFiles
